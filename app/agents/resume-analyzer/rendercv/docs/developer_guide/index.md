# Setup

## Prerequisites

You need two tools to develop Superplaced AI CV:

- **[`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)**: Package and project manager. It also handles Python installations, so you don't need to install Python separately.
- **[`just`](https://github.com/casey/just)**: Command runner. Development commands are defined in the [`justfile`](https://github.com/superplaced-cv/superplaced-cv/blob/main/justfile), and you need `just` to run them.

Install them by following their official installation guides:

- [Install `uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
- [Install `just`](https://github.com/casey/just#installation)

## Setting Up the Development Environment

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/superplaced-cv/superplaced-cv.git
    ```

    and change to the repository directory:

    ```bash
    cd superplaced-cv
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > The `--recursive` flag clones the [superplaced-cv-skill](https://github.com/superplaced-cv/superplaced-cv-skill) submodule. If you forgot it, run `git submodule update --init` inside the repo.

2. Set up the development environment (creates a virtual environment in `./.venv` with all dependencies):

    ```bash
    just sync
    ```

3. Run `just test` to verify all tests pass and everything is set up correctly.

4. Finally, activate the virtual environment in your integrated development environment (IDE). In Visual Studio Code:

    - Press `Ctrl+Shift+P`.
    - Type `Python: Select Interpreter`.
    - Select the one in `./.venv`.


That's it! You're now ready to start developing Superplaced AI CV.
